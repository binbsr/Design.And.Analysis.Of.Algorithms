# Design And Analysis Of Algorithms (CSC-314)
## We will be implementing algorithms viz. iterative, recursive, divide-and-conquer, dynamic, greedy etc. in C# and analysing them to tie up with theoritical Big-Oh of the same.

## Nuts and bolts
- [x] Install latest stable *.NET Core SDK*
- [x] *Visual Studio Code* (VS Code)
- [x] *C#* extension (Omnisharp) for VS Code
- [x] *Git for Windows* is installed on your laptop thereafter you can use regular cmd or git bash to run git commands.
- [x] Clone the repository to your laptop (on some relevent folder): ```git clone https://github.com/binbsr/Design.And.Analysis.Of.Algorithms.git```
- [x] You need GitHub Account, Create one if you are not there already.
- [x] There on, you will be making changes to the repo you cloned and pushing changes to remote github repo accordingly.
